# Crowd-Data-Visualization
### Research Experience for Undergraduates - University of Minnesota, Summer 2015

As a Research Assistant in Stephen Guy's lab at the University of Minnesota, I analysed large datasets of 
people's movements in crowds (in shopping malls, busy streets, etc) to identify trends in how pairs of
individuals navigated crowded space. This built upon earlier research performed by Guy which found the applying
principles of particle physics could accurately model the movement of individuals in crowds.

I used Matlab to extract and analyze the information from the dataset, and then modeled my findings with Unity 
Game Engine. I generated simulated data with my model in Unity, and compared this to trends in the original data.

The files included in this repository are examples of the visual analysis utilized throughout the course of this 
project. Each jpeg shows a different aspect of the data sets, both natural and simulated. I have also included 
my final paper for a more comprehensive overview of the project and a more thorough description of analysis 
techniques and results.
